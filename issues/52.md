## [#52](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/52) - update jira url after initial setup

### [mrs-mrl](https://github.com/mrs-mrl) commented on Aug 15, 2022

When the jira URL changes, there's no way to simply update it. Basically things are broken and you're stuck on the dashboard. This could be easily fixed by simply re-enabling the initial setup procedure when no conenction to the dashboard was possible.

Hi, Will think about it and implement it ASAP. For now you have an option to directly access the integrate url and get integrated with new url. But this will create a separate profile in Jira Assist. So that all your settings are new. You will have to add them newely.

OK, thanks! For now we went with deleting the profile. It is not too much of a hassle, but recreating the profile is a bit tedious.

Hi @mrs-mrl 
This issue has been partially resolved as part of #105. You can go to Advanced Settings page and edit the url of any instance you have. But this is only possible if you are using more than once instance. If you have only one instance and if that instance is not accessible, then this solution will not help you for which I would be adding an option to change it somehow from 401 page.

Sounds good. Luckily we haven't had this issue again, as the URL hasn't changed since. :)

Jira Assistant v2.41 has options page from where you can change the Jira url and few other settings. To view options page right click on the extension icon and click options.

Great, thanks! I'll close this issue then.
