@sunilthota20 - Thank you for your suggestion. This is already planned for future and already I have done some ground work on this. But deprioritized it a little as no one has ever asked for it and this option is partially available in cloud Jira. Moreover I got held up with other priority activities.

However, if you can provide reference of some tools or screenshots, that would give me a better idea on what would be more helpful for users. You can mail me the details along with any suggestions / ideas you have and I will plan for that.

Thank you @sunilthota20 for providing this reference. I will have a look and will try to implement it ASAP. However, this is totally a new module and would take some time before this is available. I will update this ticket as and when I have some progress/updates.

Hi All,
While half of the development is over using Sync Fussion components, I realized there are CSP issues with Sync Fussion which is stopping me from using it. Now going back to a different component is a complete rewrite from scratch and hence it would be too much of effort. Hence I am planning to wait and watch for the response from Sync Fussion.

Until a solution is found, this ticket is blocked.

Background of the issue:

Hi All, 
**Just an update:**
Sync Fussion has replied stating this issue would be resolved as part of August release. I will validate the fix and if that is resolved, then I would continue with the development.
