## [#114](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/114) - Unable to get id of Parent issue of a Subtask. Selecting option "Parent" is not supported.

Steps:
1. Create a custom report
2. Create a new Query
3 Add Parent in Display column

Note: Parent link is also not working. My objective is to get Parent ID of all my subtaskes so that I can group my sub-tasks. Please let me know how I can do it?

@shridhar-tl please help, I am stuck due to this. I want to build a report where I can get ID and summary of parent task of all sub-tasks.

Merging this issue with #157. Based on new enhancement, this issue would get resolved.
