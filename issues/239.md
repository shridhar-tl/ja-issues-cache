Hi there,

In JA Build 07-Nov-2022 in both web and local.
Chrome: Version 107.0.5304.89
Windows 10 Pro - 19043.1526

In "My Open Tickets" using the kebab menu I can add worklog entries ok.

In any custom report the same action results in:

and console entries:

I have tested two instances, one authenticated via user/password login and one via OAuth with the same results. Hope this helps.

Cheers,
Sean
