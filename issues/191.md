## [#191](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/191) - Updating My Open Tickets Gadget does not update pointers for worklogs generated from the gadget.

Google Chrome Version 89.0.4389.114 (Official Build) (64-bit)
JA v2.31

If a user resolves a Jira ticket, then refreshes the My Open Tickets gadget to update their list, worklogs generated through the gadget still point to the pre-refresh ticket list.  A full refresh of the page properly updates the associations.

1. User resolves DB-8826, which was the first item in the gadget list.
2. User refreshes the My Open Tickets gadget, which now lists DB-8830 as the first ticket.
3. User generates a worklog for DB-8830 through the gadget.
4. The worklog generation modal appropriately lists DB-8830.
5. After confirming the worklog creation, the Worklog Pending Upload modal updates with the new worklog, but points to DB-8826.
