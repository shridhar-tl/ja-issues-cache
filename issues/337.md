### Bug Description

I am sorry, but I am not entirely sure if this should better be an enhancement. But e.g. Worklog Calendar is not working for me.

The Jira Cloud instance contains a very large project. And the JQL used for fetching worklogs fails with Internal Server Error 500.
JQL used for Worklog Calendar looks like `worklogAuthor in (currentUser()) and worklogDate >= '2023-10-08' and worklogDate < '2023-10-17'`. 

When using the query console in Jira itself it results in the same error. But it is quite easy to compensate for this by adding `AND project!=VERYLARGEPROJECT`.


**Please add functionality to customize worklog JQL.**

I have this issue as well and have been working with Atlassian cloud support for about a month on the same issue. The problem is that the queries times out. They did say that they add some additional indexing to the tables to make it work better but it seems to be hit or miss. I have found that adding `ORDER BY updatedDate DESC` to the JQL makes the query much faster.
It would be great is there was a setting to add additional JQL to the query that the calendar feature uses.
