### Feature Suggestion

I'd like to see the overlap of work logs by members on my team. Currently, I can see a visual representation of the work logged throughout the day for myself in the Worklog Calendar. But I need to see the overlap of reported work for other team members as well. This would also be helpful to see when team members have started working and ended their work day. 

Side note: Thank you so much for this tool! It's already made my life so much easier as I've started a management role.
