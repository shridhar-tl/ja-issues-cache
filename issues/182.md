## [#182](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/182) - local time does not match between Jira Service Desk and Jira Assistant

### [ITGuyOhio](https://github.com/ITGuyOhio) commented on Jan 04, 2023

When I record time in Jira Service Desk (ex 15min logged at 07:00 AM) the incorrect time is displayed in Jira Assistant (from previous example 15min is logged at 05:00 PM not 07:00 AM).
I've checked the Time Zone setting matches in the Jira Assistant-User Groups and in my Atlassian profile
chrome-extension://<removed>/index.html#/2/settings/usergroups
https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/account-preferences
What else am I missing? Please advise

Thanks
Matt Kinne

Hi @ITGuyOhio , You will need to verify if your local timezone is same as that of Jira's timezone. The timezone you set in User groups is just for viewing the report. But when you log the work, it would log based on your local timezone.

Thank you for the response. I will confirm this.
I actually think it is an issue with Google Chrome (other browsers report
the correct time). If I visit
http://browserspy.dk/date.php
or
https://whatismytimezone.com/
They both report my time is 10 hours ahead.

again, thanks for the response. If you have any thoughts on my last comment
I'd appreciate some ideas.

I've already tried many things
Confirmed BIOS time
Confirmed system time/timezone
wiped and reinstalled Chrome
logged in with fresh user account
