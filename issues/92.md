## [#92](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/92) - Security of Jira Assistant

Could some1 tell me more about security of this solution? Is it possible that this addon somehow will steal my data from google/jira account? Usually data stored on gmail /jira account are quite sensitive.
