## [#5](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/5) - Need option to configure display fields in user daywise report

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Sep 14, 2019

User should be provided with an option to select additional fields to be displayed in report so that they can select appropriate fields and format it as necessary.

This requirement will be fulfilled as part of #41 using which user can build a new report like User daywise with all the required fields.
