Hi @RobbeVer - Sorry for the inconvenience, however I was not able to reproduce it in any browser.

Not just with Opera, I have tried with Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Vivaldi also and everywhere it works well.

So can you please provide me with the exact browser version (not JA version) so that I will try to see if that specific version has any issues.

Hi @RobbeVer - You can try using the Web version using the following Url and see if it works well for you. If it works well, then you can continue to use it till the time new updates are published to Extension. Also let me know if it works well in Web so that I will know the change I did fixes the issue or not.

Web Version of JA: https://app.jiraassistant.com/?authType=1

You need not do any separate authentication in web version. Still authentication is taken care by Extension itself while web is just used to display the page. So Web helps you use latest code with bug fixes without compromising on any aspects.

You can also permanently switch to Web so that just in case of such issues, you will know in advance even before I publish the extension so that the issue can be reported and immediately I would be able to resolve it.

Once the changes are published to extension, it takes time to push another version due to various limitations.

To know more about Web version, you can have a look into following Urls:

@ch-fuchs - As I mentioned in my previous comment. I have already given a fix and is already available in Web version. You can switch to web version temporarily to see if the fix is working.

Switching to web version is seem less and has lot more other benefits as well. Read through my previous comment to know more about it.

### [ch-fuchs](https://github.com/ch-fuchs) commented on Aug 29, 2023

@shridhar-tl Tried the web version and the fix works - no more big youtube image upon login. Thanks!

Switching to the web version seems like an easy win, but (some of) our customers might be worrying about data protection as all JIRA data would be visible to your web platform. Anyways, thanks for the advice and the fix!

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Aug 30, 2023

@ch-fuchs - Thank you for confirming the fix works. Will try to publish the fixes ASAP.

When you talk about data protection in Web version, let me clarify you few points:
1.  Source code is same for Web and Extension.
2.  There is no backend server as such which is hosting this Web version. The web version is hosted within the Git Repository itself. And this is the repository which is hosting Web version. If you are not aware about GitHub pages, you can learn more about it which would give you a very good clarity on the data security part.
3. When you switch to Web version, nothing changes in how your data is handled. The data is still within your extension's cache. It does not go out anywhere.
4. It is absolutely equivalent as that of using extension except for the fact that Web uses latest code. In no way there is any technical difference between these two.
5. Until this point, there is not even an implementation done, for me to track how many users are actually using Web version. Until the time you mentioned that you tried Web (in your comment), there is no way for me to even know that a new user has tried Web.

You can learn further about it under Data Security section in following Url: https://www.jiraassistant.com/why-web-version/

**Note:** Google analytics implementation was there just to get anonymous statistics in aggregate, however that has broken years back and it is not fixed yet as I don't monitor it much. And of course that is the case for extension as well and additionally you also have option to disable Google analytics from Advance settings page.

The fix has been published for extension users and is already available for Firefox store. For other browsers it is still being reviewed. You should see it soon within a week max.

Closing this ticket as this issue is resolved and is being published for extension users as well. Once your extension version gets updated to v2.55, you should see it working.

[Update]: Except Edge store, latest version is now available in all other stores
