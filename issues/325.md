Cloud Jira

### Version of Jira Assistant

2.55

Firefox

### Feature Suggestion

The Open Tickets JQL is not editable.
This makes the feature worthless when needing to modify the JQL.

Example: Johnny is working for the A-Team in XYZ company.
He get transferred to the B-Team.
His A-Team Jira stories have not been reassigned to other A-Team developers.
So, now he see both his A-Team and B-Team Jira assignments.
He only want to see his B-Team assignments.
