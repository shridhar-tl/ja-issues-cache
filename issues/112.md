## [#112](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/112) - AM and PM is not considering

### [ashokram](https://github.com/ashokram) commented on Jan 27, 2020

Hi, it is not considering AM and PM, in the JIRA, I had given time as 03:30 PM of yesterday, but it is considering 03:30 AM of current day. Can you please check it.

Hi @ashokram, This is most probably due to the time zone difference between your system time and Jira Server. Just go to your Jira Profile and change your time zone to match your local timezone and it should be fixed.

Thank you @shridhar-tl, after changing the timezone in JIRA, it worked fine.
