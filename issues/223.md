## [#223](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/223) - Dark mode: right click show a blank menu option

Hi there!

Using V2.39 on Firefox.

There's a small issue when using dark mode. If u right click on a issue or on a day to add a worklog, you will have a blank menu:

Options will only be showed if you mouse over that menu:

Cheers and congrats for this GREAT and AWESOME plugin :D

@casper-81 - This issue has been resolved in JA v2.44. This is already available in web version and would be soon available in extensions in around a weeks time.
