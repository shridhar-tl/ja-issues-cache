### Bug Description

When I try to donate, there is a paypal button. When I click on it, it prepopulates a different unfamiliar username from India (and I am in US) and it pops up message that this option is not availabe in your country! I tried to clear my cookies in chrome, restart web assistant and still the same. So I am unable to donate.

2nd issue is on jira assistant worklog calender, when I right click on a meeting, it pops up with form and I can enter first few characters of a jira ticket and it pops up a form with list of recent matches, which is super useful in selecting the correct jira ticket. However, after every 2-3 right clicks, I notice that form popup goes behind 1st form. Meaning I can see all matched jira tickets in the background, but my focus in 1st form and so I cannot select any of them, forcing me to manually type in entire jira project name. 

Any tips to fix this
