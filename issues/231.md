## [#231](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/231) - Worklog Calendar, Month view, bottom week(s), +more popup window not in complete view

Hi,

When clicking on **+more** in the week(s) at the bottom, the popup window is not in complete view.
The window should be moved up into full view.
This issue is the same in the Chrome extension (version 2.38) and the Web version. Using Google Chrome Version 106.0.5249.62 (Official Build) (64-bit) on Windows 10.

Kind regards, Marc.

Hi @mdevosbe , thank you for reporting this issue. However this is an external library component being used and providing the fix is not in my control. I will try to get it fixed ASAP either from the component itself or by some workarounds.
