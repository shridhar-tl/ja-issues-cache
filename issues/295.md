@frgopplus - This issue happens primarily due to indexing issue with Jira. As you are using self hosted version of Jira, it becomes your companies responsibility to index your instance of Jira. Please check with your Jira Administrator to see when was Jira indexed at last. If it is long time back, then its time to re-index Jira to resolve this issue.

Such issue was raised many times so far and every time the issue was due to indexing only. So hope fully this time also same solution resolves the issue.

Other that that, just ensure that this specific Jira ticket is not having too many worklogs. When I say too many, I mean more than 1000's of worklog. If that was not the case, then most probably indexing is going to solve the issue.
