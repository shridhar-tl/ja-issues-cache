Hi @odonoghued,
Thank you for reporting the issue. However, I was not able to reproduce this issue with the steps you have provided, but I could guess what could have gone wrong and had provided the fix with some assumptions.

The fix would be available in Web version in next few minutes. Can you check with Web version and let me know if it solves your issue?

If the issue is resolved, soon within next week, I would release the fix for extension users.

If you are an extension user, you can visit the following link to use the web version: https://app.jiraassistant.com/?authType=1.

No separate integration required with Web Version for extension users. It would work just by accessing the above link.
