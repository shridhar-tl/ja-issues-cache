Hi @SSeltonrijch - Thank you for reporting this issue. However this issue has been resolved long back and you are using very old version of Jira Assistant. Current version of Jira Assistant is v2.47 and I do not see any issue with it. Look at the screenshot below with latest version:

Kindly update your version of Jira Assistant and you should see the issue resolved. To update your extension, navigate to "chrome://extension", then enable Dev mode from top right corner and then click Update extension button from top left corner. In next few seconds your extension should get updated and you will have this issue resolved.

Hoping this comment helps, I am closing this ticket. Please feel free to reopen if your issue is still not resolved.
