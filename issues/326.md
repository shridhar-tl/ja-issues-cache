Hi @dporopat, Thank you for reporting this issue. This issue has been resolved. I will soon deploy it to web version. Once deployed, temporarily you can use Web version to create the report and continue to use it with extension.

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Sep 16, 2023

The change is already available in web version and would take up to a weeks time for it to be published to extension users.

Closing this ticket considering this issue is resolved. Please feel free to reopen it if there are additional conserns.
