@Numair-Majid123 - I am not sure what is this about. This is not a feature of Jira Assistant. Where are you seeing this modal? By any chance are you using any other app named Jira Assistant and logging in wrong issue tracker?

Web version of my app is hosted in https://app.jiraassistant.com
and links of browser extensions are available in my official website: https://www.jiraassistant.com

Please clarify!
