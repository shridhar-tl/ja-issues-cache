Hi!
I tried to turn off custom field added by Jira Assistant to issue view
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d7d1052-80c1-426a-bfba-8b465db5f1d3)

But I couldn't find this option in settings. It looks like I don't have all the setting available.

I've compared it to screen shot added by someone else to one of the issues reported on this GitHub.

I tried to reinstall the App, I've tired switching form Edge to Chrome and I asked my colleague if those setting are available for him, but he doesn't see them as well.
