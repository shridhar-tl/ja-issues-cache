## [#183](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/183) - Unknown server: Not a valid jira server url

### [nkgilley](https://github.com/nkgilley) commented on Apr 23, 2021

Does this extension work with self hosted version of Jira (Jira Data Center)?  I'm getting this error when trying to connect to my company's jira.

```
Unknown server
This is not a valid Jira server url or the server does not respond.
```

I was able to fix this by adding path /jira after my company's jira server url. I saw it had this looking at the requests in the dev console. Thanks for the amazing extension!!
