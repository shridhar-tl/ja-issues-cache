### Feature Suggestion

Hi,

When using the "my open tickets"/"my bookmarks" widgets on the dashboards it would be very useful to be able to resizing and reordering the titles. This would make using the smaller widgets more useful as you could move the most important columns in the view and shrinks some down to fit more in before having to use the horizontal scroll bar.

Thanks.

wanted to suggest exactly the same - allow reordering the columns in "my open issues"
