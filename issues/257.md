### Feature Suggestion

When working on complicated, large workflows, one can easily lose the overview over which user management resources are used inside the different workflow transitions for conditions or post-functions.
Especially when trying to clean up groups in Jira it's difficult to find out, what it would break to delete a group, as Jira doesn't give a list to see where groups are used inside workflows.
A cool helper tool could be a workflow inspection tool, where one can upload the exported .xml workflow file and one can see, what resources are used in the different transitions. That way, it's easier for Jira administrators to manage their workflows, as well as their users and groups.

### Checklist before you submit
