## [#175](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/175) - HTTP/400 answer from Jira ignored while creating worklog entry

### [mlouiset](https://github.com/mlouiset) commented on Dec 27, 2022

Hi,
First, thank you for this great extension! makes my life much easier üëç 

Here is my concern:
On a (cloud) Jira Project I changed the configuration to prevent users from creating work log entries on Epics. I did this: 
https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-questions/Disable-quot-Log-work-quot-on-EPIC/qaq-p/610394#M410540
As a consequence, Jira now answers with a HTTP/400 response while attempting to create a work-log entry on an Epic. But JiraAssistant seems to ignore it.

Steps to reproduce:
- Add a new work-log entry on an Epic from the calendar view
- reload the page (Shift+F5)

Actual Behaviour:
While adding the work-log entry, the "Add worklog" window stay opened, and no worklog in the calendar view
While reloading the page, I can see the work-log entry in the calendar view, but not sync (marked as to be uploaded, which always fails)

Expected Behaviour:
display the error message returned by Jira in a pop-up window(?)

Best regards
