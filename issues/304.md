### Bug Description

When working with the tool I use the following workflow:
- I copy the ticket URL from the browser (in JIRA)
- I paste the ticket URL to jira-assistant

What now happens:
the URL get cut, and the ticket information is gone

What I would expect:
Ticket URL should extract ticket information.

Workaround:
I copy the URL to the description field to manually extract the ticket reference.

@tyriis - Hi, thank you for reaching out to me. Based on your description, it means to me that earlier you were able to copy paste the Url itself and JA was good enough to parse the ticket number alone.

However, I have never implemented such functionality so far and I am not sure how it has been working so in first place. And if it has been working so earlier, then I have done nothing recently which would break such a functionality.

Any way, let me see if I could implement it.

@shridhar-tl thanks for your reply, I don't think it has been there before.
