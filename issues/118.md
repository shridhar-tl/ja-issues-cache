## [#118](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/118) - Nothing gets displayed in the tab

### [xtreye](https://github.com/xtreye) commented on Feb 17, 2020

Once after a tab refresh, it has stopped displaying anything, no matter where I try to go through the menu. Standard Jira behaves normally. Have no clue on what might be wrong.

The following gets dropped into the console: 

```
TypeError: Cannot read property 'toLowerCase' of undefined

hl @ 4.de633dce.chunk.js:1

```

Tried to reinstall the extension, didn't help. Latest Chrome on Win 10 x64.
