### Feature Suggestion

Hi Team,

I request to add the feature where we can generate 1 worklog report from 2 different Jira's. At the moment, we have to generate 2 reports from 2 different Jira's from the same Jira assistant by updating the integrated url and we or our manager has to merge them before submitting it to the higher management of an org. It would be really helpful for both employee and managers in the organization to generate the single work log report for more than 1 Jira's. 

Please let me know if you need any more information from my end. Looking forward and hoping to get this implemented very soon.

Thank you,
Kalpit Kadia

Hi @kalpit-kadia, This has been in my roadmap since long time and is not prioritized due to various reasons:

While one of the primary reason being not many users are requesting this feature, there is one more challenge.

If same users are available in multiple instance of Jira, then identifying unique users is a challenge. while in some cases email id is same in both instance, but there are lots of cases where it is different as well.

So I am basically thinking about a way to identify users across Jira instance. Additionally if Jira instances have different time zone set across profiles, then it would cause more issues with current implementation.

Let me think through it and any suggestions are welcome.
