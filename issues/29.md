Hi @chougrani , Thank you for reporting the issue. I will look into this issue and will fix it with in this week end. But if you could share the screenshot of the filters page also, that may be helpful in identifying the issue. But if those filters contains something official and cannot be shared then no issues. I will try to sort out the issue.
