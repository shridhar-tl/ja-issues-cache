@devgurl00 - Thank you for reporting this issue. This issue would be resolved in v0.98 of Jira Assistant which would be available within next week. If you face any of this issue after your version gets updated to v0.98, please send the details available in your browser console which would help me to debug the issue.

This issue has been resolved long back, but I am facing some issues in publishing and not able to get any support from web store team due to the current lock down situation as mentioned in other tickets. Hence their would be some more delays till the situation comes under control.

This fix is published now in chrome extension as well. So you should see it working going forward. Thank you all for your patience. But for getting the fix published to chrome, some permissions given to chrome extensions were removed to get the approval in review process. As a result some of the minor features were removed as well. More in particular, Report Builder feature, excel export feature, first time integration, etc., may face some issues / change in the way of implementation.

To know exactly what is impacted, see version history in the extension.
