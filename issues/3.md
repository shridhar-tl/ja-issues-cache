## [#3](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/3) - Uploaded worklog should not be locally tracked

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on May 30, 2018

Once the worklog is uploaded it should be tracked only from Jira server and not from local anymore so that following issues will get resolved.

* Bug #1 - Worklog goes out of sync when it is updated or deleted directly in Jira Server 
* Bug #2 - Gadgets other than reports doesn't consider worklogs added directly in Jira Server
