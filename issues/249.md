Could this be related to the changes here?

@hhofstaetter - Yes you are right and this is a known behavior. At this point using this JQL would cause some unexpected behavior. So once everywhere in the application, this new picker is used, then everywhere the JQL suggestion would be used. Most probably this would happen in next release.

Until then, all the issues would be selectable from the picker.

@shridhar-tl 
Thank you for the feedback. I downgraded the addon to 2.43 for now, that makes the search usable for me again.

@hhofstaetter - This issue has been resolved and would be available in upcoming release. However it would immediately be available in Web version of JA if you want to try.

Closing this ticket considering the issue is resolved

@shridhar-tl
My problems are not resolved. The api request is now using the JQL as configured, but its still getting other results then the previous issue picker.

The previous issue picker allowed Sub-Tasks to be returned, the implementation now does not return any Sub-Tasks.

The api resource needs the GET parameter showSubTasks=true to return any subtasks.
https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/api-group-issue-search/

Would it be possible to set that parameter or to make it configurable?

@shridhar-tl

all users are no longer receiving subtask suggestions in the ticket number field when entering non-ticket-number text, e.g. words from the summary. JA does retrieve the correct subtask when we type the subtask ticket number. Also, it is suggesting all parent tickets where before it showed only open tickets assigned to that user.

If this isn't related, I'm happy to create a new ticket

@shridhar-tl 
Works now in the app. Thank you.

@githubdarren - you can control the list of tickets shown using the Suggestion JQL from Advanced settings page. This is actually an enhancement done to pull all the tickets in suggestion based on feedback form multiple users since last few years.
