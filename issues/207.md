## [#207](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/207) - Link with Gmail – Google flagged the extension

I tried to link my Google Calendar, went on to sign into my Google account and Google wouldn't let me go further as "There is a security risk".

Not sure what that is or even if there is a solution but I just wanted to let you know.

Duplicate of #155, hence closing this issue.
