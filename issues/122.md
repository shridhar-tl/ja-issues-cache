## [#122](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/122) - Missing documentation: How to build for Chrome

### [StephanMeijer](https://github.com/StephanMeijer) commented on Mar 27, 2020

The documentation is lacking a guide how to build this extension for Google Chrome.

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Mar 27, 2020

Following document contains information required for building the package for all browsers. Hence closing this issue.
