Cloud Jira

Chrome

### Feature Suggestion

Please add "Assignee" to the "Worklog - [Pending Upload]" gadget. Preferably after the Summary column, like the "My Bookmarks" gadget. This would be very helpful for quick validation to see if the task I'm uploading is assigned me or someone else. It is easy to transpose the Ticket No. and accidently log time on task that happens to be assigned to someone else.
