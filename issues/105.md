This settings module should include following settings and should contain settings for all the instances to gather:

Modify query to fetch tickets list for suggestion: - #100 
Query related to My Open ticket: - #73
Jira Url & related settings: - #52 
All other internal query and configs.

New Advanced Settings page is added to change the system properties and would be still enhanced.
