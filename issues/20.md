## [#20](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/20) - Firefox version of extension was disabled after the latest release of Firefox

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Dec 05, 2019

After the latest version of Firefox is released, for some users the extension is automatically disabled / removed.

**Solution:**
If the extension is disabled you can enable it again from the "Add-ons" menu in Firefox. If it is removed, then you will have to install it again from the following URL: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jira-assistant/

But unfortunately, in store as well it is disabled. So till new version is uploaded again to Firefox addons store, their is no way around this to use in Firefox. I assume a new version will be available for Firefox in a couple of weeks from the date of this issue being raised.

This issue has been resolved and now Firefox version is again available for use. Hence closing this ticket.

Hi @TISindiaSupport ,
Jira Assistant will not be available in Firefox Addon store anymore. You have an alternate for this from the issue #43 .

You can find the download link for Firefox version from the below url: https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant

Jira Assistant is once again available in Firefox addon store since long time now.
