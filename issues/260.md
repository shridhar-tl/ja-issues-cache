Hi @SelvalakshmiPraveen - I intentionally did not add it to new worklog report because there are more option to group the worklogs based on project, epic, issuetype, etc which implicitly gives the details which was available in Summary tab. So I do not see the need to have that tab separately.

To enable custom grouping open Report Configurations from top right corner and look at the Datasource tab for "User worklog grouping" as shown in following screenshot. If you still see any need for Summary tab, please let me know what is that you like over there and I will think through it.

Until you get back, I assume the option is already available in different place and hence closing this ticket. Please reopen with your comments as necessary.

Shridhar,

Thanks for your quick response. I see the grouping options are given already. But Summary Tab is unique and was very helpful. It gives us the insights about the total worklog of user as well as the Project in one single view in horizontal and vertical ways.

In grouping option, for example if I group by Project, I will get a worklog Project wise only. If I need to check for one user, I need to again switch the grouping. In Summary tab, As everything was in single wise, it helps us to create a report and submit it to our Management. 

Grouped Option :

Worklog Option (Here it more readable as it is horizontal and vertical manner) :

Also, the old worklog will get removed and it will be there always?
