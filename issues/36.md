## [#36](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/36) - Jira assistant for Firefox not existing

### [kkrajcek](https://github.com/kkrajcek) commented on Jun 01, 2018

From Jira Assistant description I saw that it should be also supported within Firefox

For Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/jira-assistant/

Link does not work and plugin can't be fount for Firefox

Hi, Due to some compatibility issue with latest version of firefox it got disabled. I will re enable it this week end. You should see it available again in the same url.

Sorry about it. I got held up last week with some official work. So unable to work on this. Will definitively be enabled by this week.

This issue is resolved. Now it is available in Firefox add-on store.
