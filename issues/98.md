## [#98](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/98) - Update Calendar/Worklogs Week View to use row banding

### [EH-DUMAC](https://github.com/EH-DUMAC) commented on Dec 28, 2022

Can row banding be added to Calendar/Worklogs Week View so it easier to see where to click for a particular time?

Using something like:
tr:nth-child(even) {
    background-color: #8dcdff21;
}

Adding Item Colors to the existing Calendar Configurations screen?

Hi @EH-DUMAC, This implementation is done in JA v2.44 and would be published within couple of days. Closing this ticket considering the implementation is done. Please feel free to reopen it if you feel something is not right.
