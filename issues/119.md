This extension stopped working on my side starting from last Thursday. I believe it's related to Jira Cloud's API update the did.

Reinstalling just meant I got stuck at the "Integrate with" setup box.

Seems like it was resolved a few days ago in #115:

Just got to wait for Google's review process ðŸ˜´

+1 not working at Chrome

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Feb 18, 2020

v0.95 was published which should solve most of the issue. It is available in Firefox already. But Chrome takes time for review and may take upto 4 days unfortunately.

But additionally, Jira has issue with User-Agent header of Chrome v80 and Firefox browsers which cause XSRF check failed issue for POST and PUT requests. For Firefox workaround is available since long time. But for chrome it just started occurring. Basically I will have to try to remove or modify User-Agent header in request to solve this and chrome does not support doing it. So still no solution was found to solve this issue and I was stuck here.

After your version gets updated to v0.95, sometimes you may need to remove and add the users to user groups once again for the reports to work.

I know this is annoying , but right now have lots of issues to work and its hard to find time to fix issues for which workaround is available.

Where we can download chrome extension manually without waiting for approving chrome review ?

### [vinaychavadi](https://github.com/vinaychavadi) commented on Feb 19, 2020

I tried with Firefox and Chrome multiple times but the 0.95 version  it is not working. Plz help!!

### [dastan1302](https://github.com/dastan1302) commented on Feb 20, 2020

We need to wait for 0.96 until chrome store processed it

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Feb 28, 2020

Hope this issue got resolved and remaining issues would be resolved by v0.97 version. Their are other open tickets related to this issue and hence closing this issue.
