Hi @taboo180 - Thank you for contacting me. This has been a known issue over years and already multiple users has reported about similar issues with calendar in #55 and #146. However there are some limitations with the calendar control I'm using and I do not see any straight forward option to support this date format.

I will have this ticket open and see if there are any updates in the calendar component supporting this configuration.

Hi @taboo180 - This issue has been resolved and is already available in Web version. It would be available in extension from v2.48 which would be published in another couple of weeks.

Closing this issue considering this issue is resolved. You can look at the changes in Web version for now and feel free to reopen this ticket if you observe something is not as expected.
