## [#8](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/8) - Need ability to save the selected date range in User - daywise report

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Dec 27, 2022

If the user has selected a date range like "This Week" in the report then this option should be saved by default and next time should auto populate the date.

Problem with this approach:
At this point when the user select the date range the report is populated. If the field is auto populated based on user's preference then at what point can the report be rendered?

If report too need to be auto rendered then sometimes if user load this page unexpectedly then also the report will start rendering which is unnecessary. So need a better way to implement this feature. Till a proper approach is identified this ticket will be on hold.

This implementation is done long back and hence closing this ticket.
