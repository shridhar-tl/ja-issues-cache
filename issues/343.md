@viquaralam - As the error message says, have you tried granting permission. This is basically a permission issue. Extension should have shown popup while trying to integrate the first time. If the user have denied it, then sometimes extension cannot show the popup again. In such cases you can grant permission for the extension to access your Jira site manually.

Have a look at #214 where I have already explained the steps to manually grant permission. Refer to heading "Check if Permission is granted for Jira Assistant:" in the above mentioned ticket.

Another simple option in chrome is to do the following. 
- Open your Jira site and then right click on the extension icon
- Either select "On all sites" or select your site from this option:
