## [#228](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/228) - Save date range in Worklog report

### [Matysh](https://github.com/Matysh) commented on Nov 12, 2022

Please add ability to save configuration on screen "Worklog report" to avoid to set the date range every page openings.

This is duplicate of #8. How ever this is implemented and is already available in Web version. Same would be published and would be available for extension users as part of Jira Assist v2.42.

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Nov 12, 2022

Jira Assist v2.42 is already published and this fix is available now. Hence closing this issue.
