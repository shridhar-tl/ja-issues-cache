## [#7](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/7) - Provide option to directly change the status of an issue from the tool

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Feb 16, 2023

User should be provided option to change the status of the issue directly from the tool so that they can close the issue, resolve it or change it to appropriate status.
