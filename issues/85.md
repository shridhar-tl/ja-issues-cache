## [#85](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/85) - Export to CSV not available in BETA

### [Szabotic](https://github.com/Szabotic) commented on Sep 30, 2019

Hi,

I am happy to see you are continuing to develop JIRA Assistant, it's a great tool.

I tried the new BETA version today and I noticed there is the option to 'download as CSV' is no longer available when using the 'Worklog Report'.

Was this intentional? Is there are plan to have this re-introduced later on?

Thanks in advance

This is known issue and already implemented it in most of the modules now and will be published by end of this week. You should see it working by next Monday. Thank you for taking time to report this issue and I appreciate pointing any other issue you face going forward as well.

Apologies if I have doubled up the issue, I did not spot this was already a known issue!

Thanks for picking this up and responding.
