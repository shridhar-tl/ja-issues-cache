## [#144](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/144) - My Open Tickets - error from Jira response

First of all - really great extension!!

My Open Tickets does not work. There is a never ending loading. I'm using latest Jira on Jira Cloud.

The errors from API:
```{"errorMessages":["Field 'resolution' does not exist or you do not have permission to view it."],"warningMessages":[]}```

```Request URL: https://<domain>.atlassian.net/rest/api/2/search?jql=assignee%3DcurrentUser()%20AND%20resolution%3DUnresolved%20and%20status%20!%3D%20Closed&fields=issuetype%2Csummary%2Creporter%2Cpriority%2Cstatus%2Cresolution%2Ccreated%2Cupdated&maxResults=1000
```

Sorry! I found advanced settings and there we can modify query for open tickets and suggestions. My bad!
