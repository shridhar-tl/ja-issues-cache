Hi @NeoMatrixJR - Thank you for your suggestion. I am trying to use all my spare time to provide new features through which most of the users would be benefited. Based on Analytics, not even 8% of users are changing the default theme and so it looks like users are not interested in themes. So I would have this prioritized based on users request.

Anyone like to contribute in adding new themes can add styles and create a pull request on develop branch. More details available in following link
