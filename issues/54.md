## [#54](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/54) - Being able to configure/disable maximum required comment length when logging work

### [jpammer](https://github.com/jpammer) commented on Oct 01, 2018

Not sure if this was intentional, but in JIRA it is also possible to omit comments when logging work. In my opinion it should be configurable if a comment of a defined length must be added in order to be able to log work.

Hi @jpammer, Your request to add settings for comments length has been implemented and is available from version v0.63. Once your extension gets updated you should see new option under Settings -> General (menu) -> Worklog (tab). Currently the settings is defaulted to 5 chars. You can change the limit or set it to 0.

Hope this works for you. Please check and let me know if the solution works for you.
