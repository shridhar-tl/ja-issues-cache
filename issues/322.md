### Bug Description

I've created Custom report and add it to my dashboard.
When I try to add worklog on this report the "kebab" icon offers me option to add worklog, however no pop-up window opens.

I can Add issue to bookmarks or start timer, but Add worklog option does not work.

Additionally: right mouse click on the issue does not open menu, only the kebab icon does.
