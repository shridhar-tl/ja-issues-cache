Hi @SelvalakshmiPraveen 
Thank you for reporting this issue. However, I was not able to reproduce it in my end.

Can you please send the screenshot of console error log also so that it would give me a clue of what is causing this issue. Also let me know if you are using sprint wise report or date range wise (default) report.

### [SelvalakshmiPraveen](https://github.com/SelvalakshmiPraveen) commented on Jul 26, 2023

Hi @shridhar-tl ,

Thanks for your reply. I am using the date range wise report (default). Please find below the Console log error message. I have also attached the screenshot for your reference.

Hi @SelvalakshmiPraveen,
You mentioned you are using web version of Jira, however looking at screenshot I realize you are using chrome extension.

Can you let me know what version of extension you are using? As far as I know this bug is already resolved in latest version of chrome extension. If you are using old version of extension, please update your extension to JA v2.52 and this issue should get resolved.

To update your extension please go to chrome://extension and turn on dev mode from top right corner and then click update button from top left corner. This should most probably solve this issue. If you were still not able to resolve this issue, try visiting https://app.jiraassistant.com/?authType=1 and see if you were able to reproduce this issue and let me know.

Apologies for the inconvenience caused, however as I was not able to reproduce the issue in my end, I need more help from you to identify the root cause of this issue.

Hi,

Thanks for your great support. After I have updated my chrome extension, I
am able to view the New worklog report Page.

We are good to close this ticket now.





Warm Regards,
Selvalakshmi Praveen Kumar
