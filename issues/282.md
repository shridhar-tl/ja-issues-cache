@toebgen - Thank you for reporting this issue. Some of the users like you using Web version is really helping me to identify the issues much quicker before I publish the updates for extension users.

Once updates are published for extension, the time to resolve this issue is very huge due to Web Store review process.

Now this issue is resolved and in next few minutes, you would be able to see in updates in Web version.

Considering this issue is resolved, closing this ticket. Please feel free to re-open it, if you face any other issues.
