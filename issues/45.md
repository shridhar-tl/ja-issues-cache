## [#45](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/45) - JIRA Assistant not loading

### [AFSkier](https://github.com/AFSkier) commented on Oct 29, 2018

BUG: JIRA Assistant will not launch and hasn't been able to for the past 2 days.  While launching JIRA Assistant, I get a "Loading....Please Wait".

@AFSkier , Can you please check the console and let me know if their are any errors?

[Update]
Also it could be related to #18. Go through #18 and see if your issue gets resolved.

Hi @AFSkier, closing this issue as I haven't heard back from you from long time. If you still face any issue please reopen the ticket or create a new ticket with required details.

I'd like to reopen this is still an issue, it is not resolved, JIRA Assistant still does not load on Chorme on my work PC.  In the interim, I've been using JIRA Assistant on FireFox as a workaround.

Before reopening this bug again, I attempted to resolve the issue by doing following:
1.	Cleared Chrome browser cache
2.	Removed the JIRA Assistant from Chrome add-ins (extensions), then re-added it.

The issue is only with my work PC. Other Chrome add-ins do not have this issue on other PCs. The issue originated when I did changed my JIRA/Atlassian password a couple of months ago.

@AFSkier - Image attachment is not available. Can you please attach it once again. Better login to Github and attach the image rather than replying through mail.

Chrome Console Errors (see attachment).

Console error doesn't provide all the required details. But it looks like AJAX call to your Jira server is failing due to some issue. But the error code is not properly available in console other than a 405 http error code.

To be more precise on what request is getting failed, I may need the screenshot of the network tab. You can open the network tab and refresh the page. Then check what request is getting failed and send the screenshot along with the header related details. You can click on the failed request to view the error details and send the screenshot of it. BTW, sorry for bothering you again.

Again be sure you do not expose any sensitive information while attaching the screenshot.
