### Bug Description

I am sorry, but I am not entirely sure if this should better be an enhancement. But e.g. Worklog Calendar is not working for me.

The Jira Cloud instance contains a very large project. And the JQL used for fetching worklogs fails with Internal Server Error 500.
JQL used for Worklog Calendar looks like `worklogAuthor in (currentUser()) and worklogDate >= '2023-10-08' and worklogDate < '2023-10-17'`. 

When using the query console in Jira itself it results in the same error. But it is quite easy to compensate for this by adding `AND project!=VERYLARGEPROJECT`.


**Please add functionality to customize worklog JQL.**
