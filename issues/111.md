## [#111](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/111) - (Add Worklog screen) Show issue key title after having searched for & selected it

When searching for a key while adding a worklog, the title is displayed:

However once that key has been the selected, the title is not displayed:

Unfortunately implementation of this suggestion will need considerable effort and outcome value is small. Hence will be implemented only if popularity is more.

Anyone interested in this suggestion please +1 this issue. Also anyone interested is welcome to raise a PR with this change.

Hi @cliaz, this implementation is done in JA v2.44 and once your extension gets updated to latest version, you will start seeing the changes. Hence closing this ticket considering it is done.
