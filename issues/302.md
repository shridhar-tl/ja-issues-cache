Hi @JellBean88 - Thank you for reaching out and here is my reply:

All the fields available in issue can be added from Settings -> Fields list tab. You can select the appropriate fields and it would show. So its up to you what field you add.

And sub tasks do not have epic link mapping and so that is not applicable for subtasks. 

Please let me know if I miss something.
