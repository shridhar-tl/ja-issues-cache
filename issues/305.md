### Bug Description

I want to add additional fields to the worklog report, in order to make it easy to see where the time is spend. But somehow I am not able to add any additional fields.
First I tried with some of our custom fields, which didn't work. Also just tried with the standard "Status" field.

No errors, but also no data, where I expect it to.

Hi @TueDissingWork - When you mean "no data", are the columns getting displayed in report or not?

Here are my settings:

And here is the report with selected columns:

Please provide more details on what is happening with your end.

Thanks! This is pretty much what I am doing, but just with different fields....

I just get empty fields; however the worklog data is presented, so something is coming back :-)

~~Can't seem to capture the request/response using the normal website debugger. Any way to see what is actually returned in the plugin or when running the website edition?~~
Found a way to get the info; will report back if I find something.

Well it actually looks like the requested custom fields isn't part of the request to Jira, which would explain why that are not returned

Just to further clarify; the columns are shown but seems to contain no values for the individual fields. And as stated above, it seems that these fields isn't part of the request/search query.

@TueDissingWork - I tried enough with cloud version of Jira and I was not able to reproduce it. I do not have data center version of Jira at this point. I will try to setup an instance this weekend and will try to reproduce it. Will get back on this by this week end.

@TueDissingWork - I have done Data center version of Jira setup and was able to reproduce the issue. This was due to the difference in API schema between Cloud and Datacenter version of Jira. I have resolved the issue and the fix is already published to Web version of Jira.

Please verify the fix by trying to use web version and let me know. You will have to unselect and reselect the columns once again from settings page as old configuration would be wrong. I will push it to extension users soon after that.

Note: Web version with work with extension for data. It does not store or retrieve any of your credentials. It just uses latest code to display your data provided by extension. So you need not worry about reintegrating with Web version. In fact once you unselect and reselect appropriate columns, even extension will start populating the data as the configuration would get corrected in extension.

Very nice.
Just verified it in the web-based version. Fields are populated as epxcted.

Thank you for the really quick fix!
