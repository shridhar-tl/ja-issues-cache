## [#179](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/179) - Worklog with ic time

### [Vaelek](https://github.com/Vaelek) commented on Dec 25, 2022

My employer has configured IC Time to handle worklogs. There is a required "Action" field that I cannot set from JA. The Activity selection does not populate within Jira itself unless a ticket number is present. Any way to make this play nicely? Currently it's just blank on anything uploaded from JA.

As mentioned in #237, these fields are external to Jira and Jira API does not support pushing the value to Jira. Hence this implementation becomes out of scope for Jira Assistant.

Have a look at the comment in #237 to know more about it.
