## [#156](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/156) - Give option to mark all notifications as "read"

In the upper right, where the notification badge indicates how many unread updates the user has and on which issues, there could be a means to mark all notifications as "read". Currently, you have to click each update for it to be "read" and decrement the count of unread notifications.

Hi @JimReprogle - Giving mark all as read is not a straight forward option here to implement here because the read status is taken from Jira and is not maintained in JA. So will think of some alternate and get back on this.
