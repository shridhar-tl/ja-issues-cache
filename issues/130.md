I second this. Also the Calendar view is broken. No errors in the console but it doesn't display any of the worklogs.

### [craigmiller160](https://github.com/craigmiller160) commented on Feb 21, 2020

I added a code change in another issue that I believe MAY fix this too, but I've done far less testing on that. Again, I cannot push to github or open a PR from my work machine, so please apply this ASAP to help get this app working again.

Yep. My PR will fix this. Just need it to be seen and merged. Hope the dev here sees it soon.

Duplicate of #126 . Hence closing this issue. You can track for any updates through #126. Also v0.97 is already available in Firefox and should fix all the issues mentioned. For chrome it would take some time for the review to be completed by Google and hence expected date for the update to be available for chrome users is 3rd of March 2020.

Error fixed in FF 0.97. Thanks.
Waiting for an update for Chrome
