## [#189](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/189) - Imported worklogs are calculated incorrectly in Epic Summaries and Time Spent summaries

### [heywills](https://github.com/heywills) commented on Nov 12, 2022

Hello, thanks for this great tool. I've been using it a while and its made my life significantly easier. 

However, the project management team I work with recently discovered that my worklog entries are throwing their reports and epic summaries off. 

**Repro steps**
To illustrate, here are some steps to reproduce the problem.
We are using Jira Cloud and Tempo. However, the error surfaces in vanilla Jira Cloud reports and exports.

- Create an Epic: "Test Summarized Work Log"
- Create an Issue linked to the Epic: "Test Issue"
- Create a CSV file with the following content, where PATTCONS-845 is the ticket number of the test issue.

```
Ticket No,Start Date,Timespent,Comment
PATTCONS-845,5/26/2021 8:00,1:00,Test log 1
PATTCONS-845,5/26/2021 9:00,1:25,Test log 2
```

- Open Jira Assistant (v 2.31)
- Click Import worklog
- Choose the sample CSV file
- Check "Directly upload worklog to Jira"
- Click "Upload 2 worklogs"

**How it surfaces in vanilla Jira Cloud**
- View the test issue in Jira search.
- Export the view to "Excel CSV (all fields)"

- RESULT: The "Time Spent" field is 5100 seconds or 5100/3600 = 1.4 hours.

- EXPECTED: The "Time Spent" field should be 8100 seconds (2.25 hours).

- View the project's Time Tracking Report. Reports -> Time Tracking Report -> Configure the report.
- RESULT: The "Time Spent" column displays 1.25 hours.

- EXPECTED: The "Time Spent" column should display 2.25 hours

**How it surfaces in Tempo**
- Open the test issue.
- Click "Open Tempo"
- Verify that the logged time is 2.25 hours.

- Open the test epic
- Click "Open Summary Panel"
- RESULT: The Summary panel shows 1.4h.

- EXPECTED: The Summary panel should show 2.15h.
- View the test issue in Jira search with the "Time spent" field shown.
- RESULT: The "Time spent" field shows "1 hour, 25 minutes"
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31112343/119585147-f3475780-bd7e-11eb-8495-9ead3b2d9288.png)

- EXPECTED: The "Time spent" field should show "2 hour, 15 minutes"

Thanks in advance for looking at this issue.

I updated the description to clarify how the calculation issues surfaces in vanilla Jira Cloud, without Tempo views.

@shridhar-tl, a colleague of mine has been communicating with Jira and Tempo about a bug that seems similar to this one. The cause might be a race condition that Jira doesn't handle. They asked if Tempo could add a "sleep time" between adding work log entries to prevent the bug.  This info might help Jira Assistant too.

> After reviewing the next steps we raised a [new bug](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-76839) describing the behavior. However, after further analyzing we noticed that this is happening when we have worklog entries that are very close to each other, as the examples, I did show previously.
What Jira does in the backend is to calculate the number of logged work and then calculate with the existing entries to show the total on the history table. However, there are some cases where two log entries are coming with ~1-millisecond difference between each other or even 7 milliseconds causing a race condition that prevents the history to effectively add the correct timing.
From Jiraâ€™s perspective, with the bug added to our product team backlog, we will eventually apply a fix to it. However, would Tempo be able to add a sleep time between the work logs that are sent to Jira? If so, we would recommend Susanne get in touch with our Ecosystem team so they can assist in defining the next steps here.

Hi @heywills , thank you for the info. Yes, your information helps. Currently I am looking for a way to reproduce this issue so that once I fix it, I can test it to ensure if it is working.

But as a result, this is going to slowdown the bulk upload / push of worklog as parallel uploading has to be disabled to solve this issue.

### [heywills](https://github.com/heywills) commented on Jul 12, 2021

Thanks @shridhar-tl. Let me know if you need any help reproducing this. I understand the impact on import performance. Ironically, being able to use a bulk import again will be much faster than manually uploading one entry at a time.

@shridhar-tl -- thanks so much for this fix (or workaround for the Jira issue). It's making my life much easier.

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Nov 12, 2022

I hope this issue is resolved and hence closing this issue. Please feel free to reopen if this issue still exists.

### [heywills](https://github.com/heywills) commented on Nov 12, 2022

Thank you. It is resolved. I have been using the fix since June. It has made my life much easier.
