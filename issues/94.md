## [#94](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/94) - "This Week"/ "Last Week" should start the week from the user setting

Based on the start of the week the **Worklog Report > Select Date Range > This Week**  should start the report from the Week begin day. This should be applicable application wide anywhere "This Week" or "Last week" is utilized.
