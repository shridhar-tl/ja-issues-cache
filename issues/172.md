## [#172](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/172) - Can't logout from the project 

### [topicaulp](https://github.com/topicaulp) commented on Jun 14, 2022

Hi, 

I can't find how I can log out of the Jira project.

I have several Jira projects on Jira Assistant and I need to remove a couple of them. 

Thanks.

Jira Assistant v2.32 has option to remove the unwanted accounts in Advanced Settings page.
