## [#48](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/48) - All the tables in the tool should be properly scrollable with static headers

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Sep 22, 2018

Throught out the tool, all the tables should be properly scroll-able. At this point some of the tables were invisible when it is too big for the screen. Also the header of the table should be always visible / static when it is scrolled vertically.
