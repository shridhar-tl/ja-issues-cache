## [#289](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/289) - better UX for short worklog items in calendar – support more granular logging

- [X] I am sure that I am already using latest version of Jira Assistant
- [X] I had verified that there are no existing requests with similar suggestion in [issue tracker](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues)
- [X] I had verified that, my query is not answered in [FAQ section of website](https://www.jiraassistant.com/faq)

### How do you use Jira Assistant?

Browser extension

### Are you using cloud version of Jira or self hosted (data center / server) of Jira.

Cloud Jira

### Version of Jira Assistant

v2.48

### What browser are you using?

Chrome

### Feature Suggestion

My job often involves a lot of context switching, like I work 5–10 minutes on one task and then 20 on another.
The current calendar view does not go well with this pattern:

The details of worklogs shorter than 30min cannot be read, the worklogs shorter than 15min look totally bogus. On Google Calendar, I can zoom in to see the short events better, but no such option here.

Also, when adding a new worklog by clicking, the granularity is always 15 minutes, i.e. any worklog can start and end on a multiple of 15min (that can be tuned on the dialog later, but it is quite a PITA).


I suggest either a setting called granularity, that can be changed from the current 15min to e.g. 5min, so that becomes the quantum of the worklogs; or to implement zooming on the calendar, and change the granularity based on the zoom level.

### Checklist before you submit

- [X] I have ensured not to paste any confidential information like Jira url, Mail id, etc.

Hi @torzsmokus - I understand your concern and sometimes I too come across it. However, it doesn't appear that the calendar control I use is supporting this option. I will do further analysis on this and see if I could work around this issue.

If not, I would raise this as a ticket in the calendar component itself and will have to wait for them to provide some solution. Let me look into this by this week end and update you in case of any findings.

@torzsmokus - I have tried to solve this issue by adding Zoom option for calendar and also by setting min height for events. 
This change would be published as part of JA v2.49 for extension users which would take some time. However it is already published for web version. You can try accessing the web version to see if that works for you.

I'm closing this ticket assuming the fix would solve your issue. But please feel free to reopen this ticket if there are any suggestions or feedback.

Hi @shridhar-tl , 
Thanks for the quick update! I checked it on the web app, and most of it works great. When “resizing” events, they still get rounded to the next 15min though :( should I reopen this, or file a new bug?

@torzsmokus - Moved this settings based on settings. If you want to enable it, you can do so from settings. Having this settings would solve #292.
