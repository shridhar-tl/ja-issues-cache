## [#14](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/14) - Notification for worklog and calendar doesn't work for some of the users

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Jan 03, 2023

This tool provides a notification feature for missing worklog and for meetings based on calendar integration. That feature is not working for some of the users in chrome and most of the users in firefox.

Need to analyse the issue and fix it. If you face the same issue then +1 this issue and provide any possible information to help me identify the issue.

As background script feature in chrome extension is no more available and the replacement is not capable to handle such use cases, it doesn't look feasible anymore to implement this issue. Hence closing this issue as won't fix.
