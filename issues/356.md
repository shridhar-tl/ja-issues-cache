### Bug Description

I have a Worklog report that contains 112 individuals across 11 groups that I run once a week for the prior week. This report has been running flawlessly for the past 4 weeks, until this week. 

I tried to run it this week (both extension and web extension v2.59) and I get "Unknown Error. Check Console for details." When I check the console, I see "com.atlassian.jira.issue.search.vsearch.SearchInternalException: Failed to run query".

I have also tried to run the report for just a single day instead of a week and get the same result.

UPDATE 5-14-24: I have had a colleague attempt to run a Worklog report on a different PC (fewer people in the report). He is getting the same error as I am.

Hi @KMD9667, this is not a usual error or I have never seen this issue before. I did a quick research and no information is available regarding this error online. So as a first step, I would request you to take the query being executed in network tab and run it directly in Jira and check. That would give you an idea of whether that query can be executed in your Jira or not. based on that we can proceed further.

Hello Shridar,

I went to the Network tab in Developer Tools and ran the report. I clear
any entries before I run the report. When I run the report, nothing appears
in the window. Here is a screen shot while it is running. Even when the
error eventually appears, there are no entries in the Network tab - no
filters enabled.

Thanks - KMD9667

Hi, I understand you have installed Browser Extension in Chrome and using JA. There is an option to switch to Web version for users who have installed extension. By any chance if you have switched to Web version earlier, you might be using Web version. In that case your AJAX requests would be routed through extension still. So you cannot see the requests through network tab.

Instead you need to open the network tab of extension.

How to know if you are using web version?
in tab if your url says "https://app.jiraassistant.com/", then you are using web version. If it starts with "chrome-extension://", then you are using extension already.

if you are using web version, then to check network requests, you can temporarily switch back to extension from top right corner by clicking on Extn button:

From extension network tab, you should definitely be able to view the network requests. Otherwise see if you have enabled some filters in your network tab which is hiding your requests.

Hi Shridar,

I was able to capture the JQL and try submitting it directly via API and UI
interface to Jira. Both cases failed with a 500 error. We opened a ticket
with ira and they say this is a known issue:
https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-83317

It might be helpful for others to upvote the fix on this issue so that Jira
handles it quickly.

I wanted to share that with you  as I'm sure that others are experiencing
the same issue.

Thanks,
Chris
