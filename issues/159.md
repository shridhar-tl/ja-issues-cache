## [#159](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/159) - Switch Between Different Report Won't Refresh

### [ghost](https://github.com/ghost) commented on Oct 17, 2020

I have two dashboards, each of them contains a report generated by report builder.

I can't click and switch between them because the page won't refresh, I have to return to default dashboard first, and then got to one of them.
