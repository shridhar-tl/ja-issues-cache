## [#110](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/110) - Issue key text shown twice when searching for issue while adding worklog

### [cliaz](https://github.com/cliaz) commented on May 06, 2020

When searching for a issue while adding worklog, the issue key is displayed twice. For example, with issue key _RTO-157_, title _General Admin_, when searching for key '157' the following text is displayed:
_RTO-157 - RTO-157 - General Admin_

I am still facing issue publishing to Chrome web store. But latest updates (i.e. v1.3) are published to Firefox, Edge and Opera already. Hope all the issues with Firefox should have already got resolved by now.

Chrome users please be patient or use Firefox version temporarily to help with your activities. Apologies for all the inconvenience caused.

This fix is published now in chrome extension as well. So you should see it working going forward. Thank you all for your patience. But for getting the fix published to chrome, some permissions given to chrome extensions were removed to get the approval in review process. As a result some of the minor features were removed as well. More in particular, Report Builder feature, excel export feature, first time integration, etc., may face some issues / change in the way of implementation.

To know exactly what is impacted, see version history in the extension.
