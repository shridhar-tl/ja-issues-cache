Hi @chenzeshenga, Thank you for highlighting this issue. This issue has been resolved and is already available in Web version.

It would take some time for extension users to get the updates. It would be available as part of JA v2.56 which is expected to be released next month.

To start experiencing quick bug fixes, switch to Web which is as secured as extension with sooner bug fixes.
Learn more about web version by visiting [JA Website](https://www.jiraassistant.com/why-web-version/)

Closing this ticket as the issue has been resolved. Please feel free to get back to me for any other queries.
