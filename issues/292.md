@jazzlyn - This issue is due to the enhancement done as part of #289 as small events are not visible. While some users feel its ok to overlap when the events are small so that its readable, others feel overlapping is not good. I couldn't find a way to achieve both. So I moved the changes related to #289 behind the configuration.

So the issue you reported is resolved as part of this fix. Hence closing this ticket. Please feel free to reopen it if you face any other issue.
