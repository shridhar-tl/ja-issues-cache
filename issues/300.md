### Bug Description

Worklog timer play/pause/stop buttons don't appear for Jira Boards that don't have rank enabled. Without rank enabled, the CSS class `.ui-sortable` is not added so the selectors don't work: https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/blob/d904205af0167c32e9337cac8dcc7d8dc98e9c9a/src/content-scripts/jira-board.js#L8-L12

Can we remove this class from both these selectors? Retaining `div.js-issue` seems to still target the correct elements from my testing, and allows the use of non-ranked boards (e.g. board sorted by priority etc)
