## [#77](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/77) - Add "Components" field to worklog

### [alexpol97](https://github.com/alexpol97) commented on Sep 04, 2019

Hi!
Can I add to the worklog a display of the "Components" field from the tasks? If possible, they should also be uploaded to csv.
