## [#126](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/126) - No data showing

### [sdsmith3](https://github.com/sdsmith3) commented on May 06, 2020

Hey! I installed this addon today (v 0.95) and it successfully integrated with my JIRA instance (JIRA Server), but no data is showing up. It pulls some info - like it can see my JIRA avatar, and I can filter certain projects and such, but my Open Issues is blank (see attached), and when I try to search for a specific issue to bookmark, I get "None of the ticket numbers provided are valid." Any ideas what might be wrong? Thanks so much, this addon looks amazing :)

What's your guys exact Chrome version?

### [shkodaba](https://github.com/shkodaba) commented on Feb 19, 2020

The same problem (don't see any data in Worklog).
plugin 0.94
Chrome 79.0.3945.130

And when I try to reinstall plugin it cannot integrate with jira.

I am actually getting this in Firefox - 73.0.1 (64 bit)

### [piranha79](https://github.com/piranha79) commented on Feb 21, 2020

@sdsmith3 looks like this is broken starting with the version 0.94 and still working in 0.93. I grabbed myself a copy of version 0.93 here https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/tree/master/release/firefox and manually installed it in firefox. Just in case you need a temporary workaround cause Jira Assistant is making your life much easier as it is the case for me.

Looks like it works after update to 0.96.
But still shows "Unable to connect to server".

Something wrong with the worklog report. The data can NOT be rendered.

@manasa08april - You will have to be authenticated in Jira when you try to integrate it. This message states that you are not authenticated.

If you are already authenticated, can you check the console and network tab for any issues and post the screenshot? When you post it please ensure you hide the confidential information like domain name, user id, email, etc if any.

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Mar 02, 2020

@DayongW - Can you check the console / network tab and see what is the error you are getting? Hope you are using Jira Assistant v0.97.

I have received confirmation from few users that the issue has been resolved and hence I feel your version would have not updated when you check or their could be some other issue.

I am still facing issues with the worklog report

Getting the above error.
The reports are coming out blank.

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Mar 14, 2020

@manasa08april - Can you check the network tab and see what is being passed as jql to server and send me the jql. This could be also caused by some custom jql you have written in worklog report. Check if you have any custom jql from config of worklog report JQL tab.

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on May 06, 2020
