## [#145](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/145) - Daywise worklog - sum total hours

### [psalkowski](https://github.com/psalkowski) commented on Apr 08, 2020

It would be really nice to have to sum all total hours in Daywise worklog (or any other kind of report). We can export report to Excel and sum it manually, so it's not urgent issue, but it will be really helpful to have it here.

The reason to have it in existing Daywise worklog is the date range. We will change one date range and it will update report and total hours.

Already worklog report have summed up total for hours logged, user wise, daywise, project wise, etc.. I am not sure where else you are expecting this feature. Can you please attach a screenshot for better understanding?

@shridhar-tl thanks for quick response! Hmm, maybe I'm doing something wrong, but I used Daywise worklog and I can see total hours per day, but not per date range. So, when I set whole month, I would like to see single total value at the top (even next to report name).

@namerci - This gadget is just to quick view for worklog. If you want a report kind of a view, then you should use Worklog report where you would be able to view report for multiple users along with multiple customization settings and summed up total.
