Hi @carlosherranz - This issue has already been resolved in v2.44 and is available. Once your extension gets updated to latest version, you should see it working.

But just in case if your extension doesn't gets updated to latest version soon, as a temporary workaround, you can go to General Settings and once change the working days configuration (i.e. unselect and reselect any of the day selected) which would resolve this issue.

Hope that helps.

Closing this ticket assuming your query is addressed. Please feel free to reopen this ticket if you feel there is still something more to it.
