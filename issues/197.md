## [#197](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/197) - Getting error when running the work log report post the automatic upgrade

Since the time the plug in has upgraded i am getting the below error when opening the dash board.

Also i am not able to run the work log report. It says that Javascript must be enabled in the browser. I have checked and can confirm that Javascript is enabled.
