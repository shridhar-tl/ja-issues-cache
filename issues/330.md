### Bug Description

Hello everyone,

we're using Jira Assistant as a reporting and controlling tool almost 6 years. 

On friday 22 we migrated our Jira to Cloud, I set a new URL in Jira Assistant so I´m connected, but If I log work on any issue in Jira it does not appear in Jira Assistant. It show in Tempo we have as a plugin, but I don´t use Tempo for work (for many reasons).

I'm desperate cos I don't know what and where to set correctly.

For example: 

1) I log work on Jira Cloud issue - it appears on issue, in Tempo but does´n t appear in JA. 

2) I log work in Tempo - it appears on issue, in Tempo, but it doesn´t appear in JA

3) I log work in JA - it appears in issue and even in Tempo

We also have and old Jira URL connected with JA and every point above work fine.

Does anyone have the same problem?

Hi @VeruBeru13 , Thank you for contacting me.

Jira Assistant works better with Jira Cloud than data center version and so you need not worry about the compatibility.

I could think of one possibility as of now. After migration, if indexing has not yet been proper, then such issues can happen for a while with Jira. This is not a long term issue usually. It should automatically get resolved after next automatic indexing which happens within Jira.

If you feel this is persisting for a while now, then first thing you can do is check with your Jira Admin to see if Jira is properly indexed.

Or you can check network tab of Jira Assistant and see if Jira is returning that specific worklog in API call while generating report. If it doesn't return then you can be sure its indexing issue only and go back to your Jira Admin with scenario.

Also ensure it not some kind of human error. Say like time zone difference and its shown in some other date. Your Jira profile and your local system time zone should match with your local time zone.
