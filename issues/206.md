JIRA ASSITANT 

Can you please confirm what steps JIRA ASSISTANT has taken to protect itself against Log4j critical vulnerability CVE-2021-44228.  Also how you ensure the customer is protected.

@Singletm2000 log4j is a Java module, and Jira-assistant is javascript.. also there is no reference to log4j in all code.

Did you review that before posting the issue?

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Jun 05, 2022

Jira Assistant is not using log4j librari. Atleast no direct reference is available. Hence their is nothing we need to work on at this point. Hence closing this issue.
