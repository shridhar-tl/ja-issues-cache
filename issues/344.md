### Bug Description

I use the worklog report to generate the report. üëç 
I add a new worklog to a specific day using the green ADD WORKLOG button that hovers on the dates.
A popup appears, I add the time and submit.
I expect the report to update the data!
BUT the report stays as is, and I need to click on Refresh report for the new data to be visible.

Expected: On adding new time, the report auto initiates a refresh??

@jarusaurus - This is a known behavior and not in just New worklog, but in old one as well.

This was not implemented due to the fact that lots of calculations are done to generate the report and including one more worklog to existing data was huge effort in terms of development.

Currently as already workaround is available where you can refresh the report with single click, this was never prioritized so far.

Currently will keep this on hold and will prioritize it when feasible.

Ref: #87 - where this was already mentioned.
