## [#66](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/66) - Enable to integrate my jira on chrome whereas i manage on vivaldi on the same pc

### [nikelkrome](https://github.com/nikelkrome) commented on Sep 14, 2019

Before all, I want to say excellent extensions. A complete tool.
I try to install Jira Assistant on Vivaldi browser and it works well.
I try to install the same on Chrome and it failed : see the attached screenshot.
I remove all extensions, clear the cache, uninstall and reinstall chrome ... nothing changes !
Help
