Hi @GregoryMachin,
Thank you for reporting this issue. This issue has been fixed and would be available in Jira Assistant v2.48. Once you have your extension updated to mentioned version, you will start seeing this fix. However you will be able to verify the fix in next couple of hours  from Web version by accessing https://app.jiraassistant.com in next couple 

And about your extension staying on v2.44, yes, this is known case. I did not publish couple of versions to Edge as those versions had known issue and I wanted to avoid it affecting all the users. However v2.47 is already published to Edge and is currently being reviewed by Web Store team. Once their review is done and approved, all the users will start getting those updates which I expect to happen within this week.

Considering this issue is resolved, I am closing this ticket. Please feel free to reopen it if you see any issue in future.
