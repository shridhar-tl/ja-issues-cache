hi @andrei0581, Thank you for reporting this issue. But I was not able to reproduce this case in my end for Jira Cloud version. However, I reviewed the code and identified account id is used while importing the user which would not work for Data center edition of Jira like in your case.

So now the fix is available in Web version of JA. You can use web version of JA for now just by visiting https://app.jiraassistant.com.

I would push the changes to extension users by this week end and you should be able to see the fixes after your extension gets updated to JA v2.51.

Closing this ticket assuming your issue is resolved. Please feel free to reopen this ticket if you still face any issue.
