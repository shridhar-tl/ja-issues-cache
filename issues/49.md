## [#49](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/49) - Ability to download  worklog reports as PDF

### [jeevanpandian](https://github.com/jeevanpandian) commented on Nov 07, 2019

It would be great if we have an ability to download the worklog reports in PDF format.

Export to PDF option added. Still styles are not exported exactly the same way. Will need additional effort in implementing it and will be implemented based on popularity.

Closing this issue as the primary request is resolved. In case of any other enhancements, let that be as part of new ticket.
