### Feature Suggestion

Hello,

Thanks for the good tool to extract the worklog report from Jira. 

For worklog report, currently we are refreshing it manually. 
We'd like to have the auto process to generate the report automatically, if possible. 

Is it possible we can have the API to get the report automatically?
or can we subscribe it and get the auto fresh then email notification to the latest report?
Any other proposal/suggestion we can use?

Thx

Hi @ding-rws - Thank you for reaching out to me. As far as I remember, usage of Atlassian services like emails/etc are limited and are charged based on the usage. As this is a free tool, introducing such functionality would incur charges and hence I'm not sure if I would be able to afford / do that.

If there are such additional changes, then I may need to introduce PRO version and collect some minimal fees from companies using such services and I'm not sure if that would be acceptable by your companies. You can let me know your thoughts.

Any way, I will look at the feasibility ASAP and get back to you with details about what are the charges from Atlassian (if any).

Thanks @shridhar-tl for the quick feedback.
Actually, I don't think we need to involve Atlassian services for it.
Not sure if JA can have the interface to extract the worklog report, then we can manage the rest.
