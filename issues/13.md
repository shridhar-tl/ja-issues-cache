## [#13](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/13) - Image export functionality need to be implemented in latest UI

Earlier export as image option was available in tool. But the implementation stopped working after a chrome update. Need to re implement the export to image feature in the latest UI where ever applicable.

Image export for scroll able table doesn't work well. Hence it is not very much useful.
