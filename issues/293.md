Hi @vidgeus @davidpurdue  - This implementation is done and it would be available for extension users once your extension gets updated to v2.49. However, it is already available in Web version. For tie being you can switch to web version and use / test it.

Here is the snapshot of how the add worklog popup appear after this implementation.

I will wait for one more week so that I can test it properly before publishing the extension. You can also try to use it from web version and let me know if you face any issues.

Closing this ticket assuming requested implementation is done. Please feel free to reopen this ticket if you face any issue.
