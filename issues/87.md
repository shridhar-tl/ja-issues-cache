## [#87](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/87) - Option to add worklog on a particular ticket for a day from Worklog report

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Jun 14, 2022

From Worklog report, under user daywise tab, user should have an option to add worklog so that user need not switch the page just for adding it. Attached a sample screenshot.

Who ever is interested in this feature please +1 on it so that I would prioritize it accordingly.

This functionality is going to be great!

Implementation of adding worklog is done. But still the report will not get automatically updated with the newly created worklog. This will be implement later after analysing appropriate way to implement it.
