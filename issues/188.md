## [#188](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/188) - Outlook calendar misses some meetings

### [hz-aroan](https://github.com/hz-aroan) commented on Jun 14, 2022

Querying the GRAPH API the default result contains only 10 events. When somebody has more than 10 events, according to no explicit $orderby is set in the query - some "random" events are missing from the calendar.

It can be solve by adding $top=100 query parameter in the outlook-service.js by editing the line:

`const calendarUrl = '${apiBasePath}/calendar/calendarView?startDateTime={0}&endDateTime={1}&$top=100';`

Thank you for your efforts Sire for developing this excellent extension!
