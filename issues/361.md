### Bug Description

I had already integrated with my Oulook Calendar. Suddenly last week an error appeared. I tried to re-integrate on the settings page and the error "Unable to integrate with Outlook Calendar!" appeared.
I looked in the console log and there was only the error message "Outlook integration failed with error: "
Is there any solution to this?

Same here... I think it started on 08.08.2024. Before that it worked like a charm. I tried it with Edge and Chrome with the extension (v 2.58) and web version on Windows.

Same on Firefox (MacOS). The entire team noticed it this morning, so might still have worked on Friday.

I forgot. As I remember, it still worked on Friday.

From the error message, it seems that the Azure Application key that Jira Assistant uses has expired. It would need to be renewed and a new update pushed.

Maybe individual users could also register their own key with Azure and hotwire their personal plugin to use these.
