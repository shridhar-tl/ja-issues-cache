## [#71](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/71) - Collaborators

### [seanericwatson](https://github.com/seanericwatson) commented on Aug 15, 2019

@shridhar-tl I would enjoy collaborating on this project. Would you be willing to publish the source code so I can create a branch?

Same from my perspective ... having some ideas for improving project planning via Gantt Chart like view to contribute.
Is there a chance you to open the sources, @shridhar-tl ?

### [nitram509](https://github.com/nitram509) commented on Aug 15, 2019

Can be closed, I believe.

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Aug 15, 2019

Closed as the source code is now available in develop branch and anyone willing to contribute can do so.
