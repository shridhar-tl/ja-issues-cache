## [#273](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/273) - Translate special characters like \n

### [kihayu](https://github.com/kihayu) commented on May 22, 2023

### Checklist before you being

- [X] I had verified that there are no existing requests with similar suggestion in [issue tracker](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues)
- [X] I had verified that, my query is not answered in [FAQ section of website](https://www.jiraassistant.com/faq)

### How do you use Jira Assistant?

Web version

### Are you using cloud version of Jira or self hosted (data center / server) of Jira.

Cloud Jira

### Version of Jira Assistant

v2.47

### What browser are you using?

Chrome

### Feature Suggestion

I recently started using the "Import Worklog" feature. At my work, it is common for me to have comments that include texts spread across multiple lines, separated with an "enter" (\n). However, when I import my work log with \n within, it is written as is inside the comment. It would be great if there was an option to translate special characters like that so they are displayed as I desire.

If I find the time, I will take a look at the source code and implement it myself.

### Checklist before you submit

- [X] I have ensured not to paste any confidential information like Jira url, Mail id, etc.
- [X] I have added required screenshots (as necessary)

Hi @kihayu - I have done some analysis on this and it seems like supporting this formatting itself is a big activity. I don't see any public library currently supporting this which can be used in JA.

Hence I am keeping this on hold until a feasible solution is found.

Reference: The following library is something to be looked at in future: @atlaskit/adf-utils. But if there are any other better suggestions from anyone please let me know.
