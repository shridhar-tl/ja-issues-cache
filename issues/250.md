Hi @Ernte1893 - This is partially a known issue. In General Settings -> Default value tab, you have a field where you need to select Epic name field. Once you navigate there it would auto select Epic Link as the value. You can change the field to be used (if required), then you can once again navigate back to report and you will see the Epic link value is populated in both the report. By default epic link should be the correct field, however in some instance of Jira it is customized and that is the reason it is necessary for the user to change it from this page.

However, I just realized that this field is not being populated in New Worklog Report, while using timeframe as sprint. This would be fixed in upcoming release in couple of week.

This issue has been fixed and would be available in JA v2.45 once published. It would immediately be available in web version.

Closing this ticket considering this issue is resolved.
