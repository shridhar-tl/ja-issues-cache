## [#59](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/59) - Create report for logged time by project

### [iraszl](https://github.com/iraszl) commented on Sep 30, 2019

A typical request from management is to have a summary of all the work done for a certain time period for a client. So the report basically would look like this:

**From Time X - To Time Y**
- Project A - 100.5h
- Project B - 50.8h
- Project C - 14h

Hi @iraszl , I would implement this functionality ASAP.

Implemented as part of #53 and is available for chrome users already.

Assuming this is working fine, closing this issue. If their is anything more to be done as part of this issue, this can be reopened or a new issue can be raised.
