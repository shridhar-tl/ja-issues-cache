Hi @jrupik - Thank you for reporting this issue. However I have tried this by multiple different ways and I was not able to reproduce this issue. Can you verify couple of things from your end?

1. First thing is to look at what is the settings in Log filter and JQL filter tab of New worklog report settings page. See if you have "Show all worklogs" selected under Log filter tab and JQL filter must be empty. I understand you mentioned you did not change any default settings, but I would like to verify some basic things first before getting into anything else.

2. If above step is proper, then try to just have only 1 group with just that user and see what is populated. While doing that have network tab open and see what is the request url and what is the response from Jira. If possible send me the screenshot after hiding any confidential information from the screenshot.
Note: From Web version you wont be able to check any network logs as all the http requests are routed through the extension if it is installed. So try this step from extension.

Based on what is the outcome of these try, let us think further.

Also can you verify if the user for whom worklog is not pulled in new report have logged on some issues which is having lots of worklogs, say like more than 5000 worklogs in a single issue?

Hi @jrupik  - I have the same issue on #254. In my testing data for the New and Old Reports is identical when viewing the Flat (Groupable) tabs, do you see the same?

The same issue - One group with one user (the same user with problems)- no data on "grouped" tab, but data for that user are visible on "Flat (groupable)" tab

@jrupik  @peterwatersfis - I put in lots of effort and just few mins back I had a hunch and tried a use case where I was able to reproduce similar behavior which is applicable only for Jira Server / Datacenter version of Jira. Can you please try to reproduce this issue again with Web version of Jira Assistant and see if this is resolved please?

Thank  you for your patience so far.

Hi @jrupik @peterwatersfis - I consider this issue is resolved and is available in JA v2.48. It is already available for Chrome and Firefox users. For Edge it would soon be published. You can either upgrade to latest version or test it with web version.

However I'm closing this issue considering it is resolved. If you still face any issue, please feel free to reopen it.
