## [#10](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/10) - Enhance the favicon / menu icon and all other icons / images in the tool

Need to enhance the icons and images used in the tool.

Users can suggest an icon design or contribute with one which suits this tool.  Also while suggesting need to ensure about any copyrights issue.

Anyone is welcome to suggest!

To everyone who come across this post: A new icon was suggested in #44. Please have a look at it and +1 if you like the new logo over the existing one.
