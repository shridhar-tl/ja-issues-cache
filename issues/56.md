Daywise/ticketwise worklog gadgets stopped working.
They were working last week.

This is happening to us as well.  Daywise dashboard works fine but no longer works in the gadget view.

I can confirm this is happening, as well.

@OskarPh - I could see their is no date range selected in your screenshot. Please check if you select a date range it is showing the data.
@photoghog , @chadb4184  - Please check if this is the case for you as well.

@shridhar-tl I did choose one of the date ranges (either by clicking directly on it or clicking on "Apply"), but I think that's the bug here, none of them "stuck".

I can also confirm the same is happening if attempting to select a custom date range, as well.
