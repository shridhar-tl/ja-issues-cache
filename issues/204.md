## [#204](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/204) - Spelling and Grammar in CONTRIBUTE.md

### [pthompso77](https://github.com/pthompso77) commented on Jun 05, 2022

In the `CONTRIBUTE.md` file, there are misspelled words and some awkward grammatical choices. Improving this would help communication.
