Hi @NidhyaRamanathan - Thank you for reaching out to me with console screenshot. However, the errors are collapsed in the screenshot and I was not able to track anything out of it.

Additionally I have tried to reproduce it in various ways and I was not able to find this error.

I would suggest you two things:
- First one is to try it once with Web version and see if you are facing the same issue.
- In extension, when you try it, have your Dev tools open and check the network log and see if there are any http failures.
- Please expand the console error and send those details which would have more information.
