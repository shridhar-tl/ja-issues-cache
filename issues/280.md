@kxMaxx - Thank you for reporting this issue. This issue would be resolved in next release of Jira Assistant and would be available for extension users by end of this month. However this would be available in web version max by end of this week.

Hi @kxMaxx - The issue you mentioned about deleting a report has broken couple of months back due to a major refactoring. Now that is resolved and would be part of next release. For now it is already available in Web version and you can use it to delete the report if you wanted to do it right away. You can access the web version by visiting https://app.jiraassistant.com and connecting with your extension.

However, I was not able to reproduce the issue you mentioned about exporting settings fails while we include reports as well. I tried to export the settings including reports and it did work without issues. Can you retry that and send me a screenshot of the console error so that I will see if error details helps me to identify the issue.

Hi @kxMaxx - This issue has been resolved in JA v2.48 and would be available for extension users by end of this month. However it is immediately available for Web version of Jira Assistant. You can try this functionality once in Web version to see if your issue is resolved.

[Background]
After trying a lots of scenario's, finally identified that export is failing due to usage of columns which has non Latin chars in field names. Following screenshot shows example of such fields from Jira. Inbuild encode function does not support this and hence had done custom implementation for the same.

I'm closing this issue considering this issue is resolved. After trying in web version, if you still face any issue, please feel free to reopen this ticket.
