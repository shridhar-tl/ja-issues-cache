## [#60](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/60) - custom report / format function: no "Get name value" for customfield

### [bk1973](https://github.com/bk1973) commented on Sep 14, 2019

custom report / format function:
for customfield (enum) there is no "Get name value" ("Count of group" only)

No more customization would be done in Custom Report as Report Builder has the ability to generate more advanced report and this requirement can also be achieved easily with Report Builder.
