## [#120](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/120) - 0.94 fix for user names does not work for reports

### [foxel](https://github.com/foxel) commented on Feb 18, 2020

I've built 0.94 version for Chrome and it's working unless you are working with worklog data of another users.
Adding user to user groups don't work as response does not contain e-mails:
```json
[
    {
        "self": "https://***/rest/api/2/user?accountId=***",
        "accountId": "***",
        "accountType": "atlassian",
        "emailAddress": "",
        "avatarUrls": {
            "48x48": "***",
            "24x24": "***",
            "16x16": "***",
            "32x32": "***"
        },
        "displayName": "***",
        "active": true,
        "timeZone": "Asia/Tomsk",
        "locale": "en_US"
    }
]
```

My temporary fix for getUserName:
```javascript
export function getUserName(userObj, convertToLower) {
    let name = null;
    if (typeof userObj === "object") {
        name = userObj.name || userObj.emailAddress || userObj.accountId;
    }

    if (convertToLower && name) {
        name = name.toLowerCase();
    }

    return name;
}
```
