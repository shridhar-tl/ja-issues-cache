## [#132](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/132) - Cannot see worklogs on calendar

### [sajjan-halarnkar](https://github.com/sajjan-halarnkar) commented on Feb 28, 2020

Hi,

From last week I have been not able to see my work log entries previously logged. I am able to enter new entries but they gets disappeared from the calendar once the calendar is refreshed. But I confirmed that the work logs are getting saved to Jira, only that they have now stopped showing in the calendar.

When I open the calendar, I get the below error :

Not sure if the issue is due to above error. Can you please suggest a solution to this?

Thanks,
Sajjan Halarnkar

What's frustrating is I have a fix for this. I pulled down the code and found the problem. It's a silly bug. The "Network error" is meaningless, not sure why that's happening, but it's not related to the worklogs.

I have a PR that fixes this. I really would like the developer to pay attention and see it.

@craigmiller160 could you tell me how to build your version in a CRX package so i can hand it out to my team.
I cant seem to get the NPM build working from the read me attached to the git repro - we've reverted back to 0.63 just get going again.

Duplicate of #130 . Hence closing this issue. Track #130 for any updates.
