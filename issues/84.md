## [#84](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/84) - Existing Custom Report fails to run in Beta

### [susan-scott](https://github.com/susan-scott) commented on Dec 03, 2019

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. open an existing Custom Report which is simple:  id = "WEBRATER-579" or id = "WEBRATER-580"  or id = "WEBRATER-571" or id = "WEBRATER-627"
2. click on VIEW REPORT

**Problem**: Jira Assist says: "Action Error. One or more of the actions failed". 
This report used to run in the previous version.
