## [#57](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/57) - Jira assistant errors out when account name has an apostrophe in it

### [photoghog](https://github.com/photoghog) commented on Oct 29, 2019

We have a JIRA user who has an ' in her username.  Whenever she tries to do anything in JA, she gets the following error message.  Is there a way to fix this without have to rebuild her id?

This issue has been updated in v0.65 of the extension. Once your extension gets updated to the latest version this issue will be resolved.
