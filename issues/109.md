## [#109](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/109) - Ability to set default value for 'Override Time Spent' field when adding Worklog

### [cliaz](https://github.com/cliaz) commented on Dec 27, 2022

We use both the Calendar and the Daywise Worklog views to add worklogs, and then use the 'Override time spent' field to set the time spent.

In Calendar, the default value is 00:00
In Daywise Worklog, the default value is 01:00

We are logging work simply in 1d blocks (8 hours), and a customisable default value for those screens would save a lot of time.

Hi @cliaz - I know its too long but this implementation is done and would be available for extensions in next publish which would happen in another couple of days.

Special thanks to @orgads for his contribution in implementing this.
