## [#64](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/64) - Unable to add users to the group

### [topraveenpaul](https://github.com/topraveenpaul) commented on Sep 30, 2019

Hi,
I was able to add myself in a user group, but unable to add other users( i have enough privileges in Jira) as it is not searching and pulling the users to the list. Basically nothing happens when i tried to add.

Is there any fix to this issue?

I have the same problem. I assume it has everything to do with the new API due to privacy regulations. https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/   ?

I'm waiting on this fix as well. Would be great to run the reports with more team members included.

@topraveenpaul & @jsouer - Sorry for delayed response. I understand the necessity of this feature. Soon I will have it implemented in the new version which is currently in BETA version.

Assuming this is working fine, closing this issue. If their is anything more to be done as part of this issue, this can be reopened or a new issue can be raised.
