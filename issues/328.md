Hi @shhs125 - Duplicate of #327. This issue has already been resolved in Jira Assist v2.56. Please update your extension and you should see it working.

 If you want to update to latest version of extension, you can do so by going to "chrome://extension", enable dev mode from top right corner and then click on update button from top left corner.
