## [#19](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/19) - Add minutes part in "Max hours to log" setting inside Settings -> General -> Worklog tab

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on May 30, 2018

Currently "Max hours to log" settings allow selecting only a hour part. Some of the teams work for non rounded hours (i.e. 7.5 hrs a day). For such cases this settings does not support selection of minutes part.

So this field must be changed as a text field where as currently it is a drop-down. This feature would be implemented soon. But to prioritize it for a even sooner fix, vote it +1.
