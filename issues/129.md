## [#129](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/129) - Unable to integrate to Jira Assistant

### [manasa08april](https://github.com/manasa08april) commented on Feb 28, 2020

I am unable to integrate to jira assistant. It always shows me network server error.
PLease check
"This is not a valid Jira server url or the server does not respond."
Where as we are using the same jira url

I think the URL is meant to be:

https://abrac.atlassian.net

Try that and it should work

Same issue

### [belek](https://github.com/belek) commented on Feb 20, 2020

It works on Firefox, Jira Assistant 0.96

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Feb 20, 2020

Please try using Firefox version for now. v0.96 would be available in chrome in next 4-5 days depending on the review process in chrome web store. At the mean time try to open console and check if you see any errors related to CORS. If you see it then their is no immediate solution as this is due to an update in chrome browser and I am yet to figure out a way to solve it.

New Version on Firefox seems to work.. little slow but works.. Thanks a lot  Shridhar!!

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Feb 20, 2020

Hi @vinaychavadi - I know it it bit slow. Due to the security updates given by Chrome currently (which will be published for Firefox also later), I will have to change some approach to have the tool overcome those restrictions which made requests to Jira bit slower. I will try and find a better option once the tool becomes stable once again.

### [vinaychavadi](https://github.com/vinaychavadi) commented on Feb 20, 2020

Thanks Shridhar. This tool is of great help for all of us who log our work in Jira in our organization. Thanks for your help. We look forward for the new version of the tool. For now we are happy that this works :)

I am still getting the same error as mentioned in the thread in both Chrome and Firefox.

### [vinaychavadi](https://github.com/vinaychavadi) commented on Feb 21, 2020

The new 0.96 version is available now on Chrome and seems to be working fine. 

### [Sixcross](https://github.com/Sixcross) commented on Feb 21, 2020

When selecting a Date on "Worklog Report" i still get the "One or more Actions Failed".
All the other reports seem to work fine.

@shridhar-tl 
Getting the following error when installing JiraAssist_Latest.xpi in Firefox 73.0.1

### [emaillenin](https://github.com/emaillenin) commented on Feb 23, 2020

I have got it working by installing Firefox Developer edition and diabled `xpinstall.signatures.required`, `xpinstall.whitelist.required` and `extensions.langpacks.signatures.required` and then installing from the XPI file.

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Feb 28, 2020

Duplicate of #126 . Hence closing this issue. You can track for any updates through #126. Also v0.97 is already available in Firefox and should fix all the issues mentioned. For chrome it would take some time for the review to be completed by Google and hence expected date for the update to be available for chrome users is 3rd of March 2020.
