Hi @Jedrzej94,
Thank you for reporting this issue. Currently after this recent update, there are no unique id's or classes which can be used to attach these controls for individual issues. This time I have tried to fix it. But not sure when it would again break.

The fix would be available for extension uses as part of upcoming release planned for next week. I will update you once again once changes has been published.

HI @shridhar-tl , any news on that? I have updated my JA to the latest version and sadly the feature is still not there. Is it still in some other branch?

@Jedrzej94 - Unfortunately, by the time updates are published, once again structure is slightly modified and it got broken already. I have already noticed it last month end, however, now, I don't see a reliable way to attach this functionality to boards.

I will wait for some more time to see if I could find a way. Otherwise, I will have to remove this functionality. For now you can think this functionality is not there anymore.

Hi @shridhar-tl, it looks like the selector has just changed by dropping a dash from the `data-test-id` which you're already using at https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/blob/8006231ac543de26b19026a868122242a242017e/src/content-scripts/jira-board.js#L20
```
    const selector = '#ak-main-content div[data-test-id="platform-board-kit.ui.card.card"]';
```
is now:
```
    const selector = '#ak-main-content div[data-testid="platform-board-kit.ui.card.card"]';
```

Just checking if you didn't have the chance to debug this, or if you're just concerned that it will continue to change and become too burdensome to keep on top of these selector and DOM changes? Its a useful feature for someone who lives on that board page day-in, day-out in the Agile world.
