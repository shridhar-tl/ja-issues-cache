Hi @Jedrzej94,
Thank you for reporting this issue. Currently after this recent update, there are no unique id's or classes which can be used to attach these controls for individual issues. This time I have tried to fix it. But not sure when it would again break.

The fix would be available for extension uses as part of upcoming release planned for next week. I will update you once again once changes has been published.
