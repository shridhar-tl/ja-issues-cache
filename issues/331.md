### Feature Suggestion

I have a requirement to add a custom field to the work log report that I cannot add at the moment. I use a custom field, called company, to link tickets to a specific company, which allows me to bill back time to a specific company.

If the ability to add this custom field is added, I will be able to draw reports and submit to each company for payment.

Hi @jouberthd - Worklog report already supports adding any custom fields to the report. Have a look at the "Fields list" tab of worklog report configuration. Refer the following screenshot:

If this is not something you are looking for, please let me know how is your requirement different from what is already available

Additionally Pivot report is being developed which you can use to generate almost any kind of report. It is still in BETA and is available only in Web version. But soon be available for extension users as well.

You can have a look at the YouTube Video of Pivot report here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hFigSvXatM&list=PLxDBQLgpBhsDGppYrDqARYULukk7XFJPV&index=10

Read the documentation in features section of official website: https://jiraassistant.com/features/reports/pivot/

or try it yourself in Web version by just visiting https://app.jiraassistant.com/?authType=1

Hi, 

When I try to add the field from the dropdown, I see the following:
<img width="674" alt="image" src="https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/assets/41195474/ece70b2f-8e20-4951-b144-a1f1dc4d28b3">

The field in Jira is:
<img width="1588" alt="image" src="https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/assets/41195474/3bf29abc-aeb5-4dd3-838e-023d7e265d74">

These are all the fields shown in the dropdown. Is there a different way of adding this field?

Aah, that means you say that field which you are expecting for is not in the list. Thank you for making sure it is not in the list, but I wouldn't have asked you to take effort in adding all these screenshots.

I basically do not restrict any field from appearing in the list:

There are two possibilities I could think of:

1. This field is some how intentionally or unintentionally restricted by your Jira Administrator from being pulled by other apps. So API is not returning this field. I am not yet sure if this is even possible, but just did a quick search and I see there are similar post available online. I will dig more into it to find if this is even feasible and get back to you if I find something relevant about it.
2. If the custom field you were asking about is managed by some other apps being installed in Jira, then it might not be returned by Jira. If that is the case I won't be able to help you with this use case.

I will look further into this by this week end and get back to you. If there is something I would be able to do, to display such fields, then will get it done ASAP.

Hello @shridhar-tl 
I also met this issue with Jira v9.10.1#9100001-sha1:8cab4d4:121.
I tried JA with Chrome extention or web version. 
Both are the same. Only some custom fields could be pulled from Jira.

If those custom fields pulling is restricted by Jira admin. Can we verifiy it by the RestAPI?
If pulling more than 2000 custom fields by JA. Any restriction here?

Thx

### [ding-rws](https://github.com/ding-rws) commented on Dec 12, 2023

Just have a try with RestAPI. The custom fields has no limitations to be called. FYI.

I hope I have resolved this issue and the fix is already available in Web version as part of v2.58. It should soon be available for extensions as well.

### [ding-rws](https://github.com/ding-rws) commented on Dec 20, 2023

Thanks Shridhar for the follow-up.
Just done a quick check on the Web version. 
Those custom fields could be sync from Jira now.
