### Bug Description

After migrating to Jira Cloud I have been having issues with the Worklog Calendar failing to fetch the worklogs. The API request returns a 500 error a little after 30 seconds. I have reproduced this on both the current version of the Chrome Extension as well as the web version.

I have been working with  Atlassian cloud support for about a month and they said it is because the query is timing out. They did say that they add some additional indexing to the tables to make it work better but it still fails much more that it works.

I have found in testing that adding `ORDER BY updatedDate DESC` to the JQL makes the query return in under 200ms.

I pulled down the git repo and added  `ORDER BY updatedDate DESC` to the following line and it is working wonderfully for me.
https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/blob/a9864b3e4abbffaba161beb19929cc7ba0454e43/src/services/worklog-service.js#L36

Would it be possible to make this change or add an additional advanced setting to add additional JQL to the query that the calendar feature uses?
