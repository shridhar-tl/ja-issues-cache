## [#97](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/97) - no vertical scrolling in calendar/worklogs

my work day never fits on screen, so i've always scrolled up/down to view it, but today there's no scrollbars and no scrolling happening - even on weeks where i have existing work logged i can't scroll down to view it all. this is in the beta, which i've been using without issue for weeks. attempting to switch back to the old version is even worse - just an empty grey pane where i'd expect to see the calendar and worklogs
