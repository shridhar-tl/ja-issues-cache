As a user, I want to see total logged time on the month view mode.
We can see an overview. What day we are missing or not enough 8 hours/day

Hi @taimaiduc, The height of your screen has to be at least 490px to show even 1 entry. If your size is lesser than that, there is no feasibility at this point to provide a solution. Hence closing this issue as not fixable
