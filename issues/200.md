## [#200](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/200) - date picker not properly pushed down

### [alainbelez](https://github.com/alainbelez) commented on Dec 27, 2022

i am currently trying to pin the window on the side of my monitor, but when window got a bit small, date picker is not properly pushed down, causing the calendar to not show properly.

easy solution is to add a clear fix after the gadget-header.
