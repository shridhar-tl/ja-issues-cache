Thank you @bagau for reporting this issue. I will look into it and fix it ASAP. Until then you may proceed with using Old Worklog report if required. Though it is deprecated, it would stay as long as all the users are comfortable with using the new report and all the reported bugs are resolved.

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Mar 09, 2023

@bagau - This issue has been resolved and would be available as part of JA v2.49. It would take few days before I can publish this change for extension users, however, it would be available in Web version within next couple of days.

Hence closing this ticket considering this issue is resolved. You can verify this fix in Web version next week and in case of any further issues please feel free to reopen this ticket.
