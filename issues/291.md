Hi @BobbieZain - This implementation is done and is already available in Web version of Jira Assistant. This would be published to extension as part of JA v2.49 in next couple of weeks max. Until then if you would like to try it to see if it works as expected, you can try it out in Web version by accessing https://app.jiraassistant.com

Hi @BobbieZain - Did you get a chance to have a look at it in Web version?

This works nicely for some field types (like "Text Field (single line)"), thanks!

What still does not work for me is adding custom fields that are of type "Select List (single choice)", unfortunately.
