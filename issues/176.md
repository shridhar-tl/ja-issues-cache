## [#176](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/176) - Safari support

### [KirillZinchenko](https://github.com/KirillZinchenko) commented on Apr 13, 2023

Hi,

Currently many of macOS users are starting to use Safari as their main browser (because of Big Sur optimizations, especially  for M1 Macbooks).

Any plans to port Jira Assistant to Safari? 

### [shridhar-tl](https://github.com/shridhar-tl) commented on Jun 07, 2022

I don't see a straight forward / easy way to port the extension to safari. It involves additional dev work as well for making it work with Safari. Hence as of now no plans in porting it to safari.

If anyone is interested in contributing your time for porting it to safari, please feel free to raise a PR with the required changes and in future I can continue to upgrade it.

Thank you for your suggestion.

I would like to re-start the need for a Jira Assistant for Safari.
Many thanks

Hi, I'm a windows user and I do not have any MAC machines. For building package for Safari, it becomes necessary to have a MAC machine with xCode installed.

Hence I would need support from other MAC users to build the package. If someone is ready to volunteer, please contact me through mail. Until then, this issue is blocked and I would not be able to proceed with it.

As I don't see any volunteer's, I am closing this issue for now. Let me look into the feasibility later at some point.
