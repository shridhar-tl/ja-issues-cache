### Feature Suggestion

When using the worklog calendar it would be useful to have a "today" button to jump back to the view that includes today's date. This will be useful when scrolling a few weeks/months into the future/past to be able to get to today's current view with a single click.

Hi @taboo180 - This was a good suggestion and I too see a need for this feature. I am just concerned about how many buttons to add on top. Will do something about it in upcoming version.

Thanks shridhar, I'm of the opinion that if the function of the buttons is clear then it shouldn't be a concern. However I won't tell you how to suck eggs =)

@taboo180 - This request has been implemented and is already published for Web version of JA. Fixes would be available for extensions in v2.48 which would be published in next couple of weeks.

Closing this ticket as it is fixed. You can test it in Web and reopen it if you still face any other issue.
