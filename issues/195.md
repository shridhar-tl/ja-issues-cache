## [#195](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/195) - Improvement: Worklog Report: Add Column: Parent Ticket Summary 

### [jaredb324](https://github.com/jaredb324) commented on Nov 12, 2022

It would be more beneficial to see the Summary from the Parent Ticket. This information is more helpful in seeing the stories that I have worked on within a sprint than the summary from the sub-tasks.
