## [#106](https://github.com/shridhar-tl/jira-assistant/issues/106) - Worklog Report doesn't work on Brave when you delete Default User group

### [KirillZinchenko](https://github.com/KirillZinchenko) commented on Dec 03, 2019

Hi,

I just tried to move my workflow from Google Chrome to the Brave browser, but I encountered a bug with your extension. 

When I am trying to check my Worklog - I can see only the blank page with a grey background. 

Looks like I also found how to reproduce it.

1. Go to User groups
2. Delete your user from the Default group (or just delete group, I can't remember what I did before on this step)
3. Save changes
4. Go to Worklog report 
5. Try to see any report

Actual result: I can see a grey background only and have some errors in the browser console

I fixed the issue when I added myself to the Default group and saved changes. After that, I deleted myself and the default group again and everything is fine now.

I don't know if it's s Brave related issue only of maybe you can try to reproduce it in Google Chrome

My Jira Assistant version is 0.87

My Brave version is:

Here's Brave Console log:

Hi @KirillZinchenko - I had fixed couple of issues in Worklog report and is available since Jira Assistant v0.88. Please retest it once your version gets updated and let me know if you still face this issue.

### [KirillZinchenko](https://github.com/KirillZinchenko) commented on Dec 03, 2019

@shridhar-tl hi, I will look into it and let you know, thanks

### [KirillZinchenko](https://github.com/KirillZinchenko) commented on Dec 03, 2019

Looks like the issue is fixed, at least I can't reproduce it anymore.

Thank you very much for your work, I will also send a little donation to your team later.
